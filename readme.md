    - Time-locked Proposals: Minimum 72-hour voting period
    
    - Delegated Voting: Employees can delegate voting power
      
    - Users earn governance tokens for voting participation which can be redeemed and also grows in value as the user base expands.



3. Risk Management System

    - Withdrawal Throttling: Tiered withdrawal limits on ckBTC based on fund health.
